# PythonProjectTemplate

This repository presents some opinionated guidelines for creating a data science and machine learning project in python. By following these guidelines you can make it easy for your code to be tested and understood by others (or yourself months from now), so they can reproduce your experiments.

These are just guidelines, not strict rules, so feel free to alter them to meet your needs. Just keep in mind the goal is that others can understand and run your code, even if you aren't around to ask questions to!

This template draws a lot of inspiration from [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/). Please read their awesome explanations!

# Getting Started
## Installing Dependencies and Packages

## Directory Structure

# Communication Tools and Code
When you work with others, it's not just about the code!

The README, CHANGELOG and docstrings are just as important.

- _README_: Summarizes the project's purpose and give installation instructions.
- _CHANGELOG_: Tell the user what has changed between versions and why, see [Keep A CHANGELOG](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
- docstrings: Appear directly in your code and give an overview of each function or object. They can be printed using `help(object)` from the python interpreter or used to automatically generate API documentation with a tool like [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html).

Read [Real Python's Documenting Python Code: A Complete Guide](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/) for more ideas about effectively documenting code.
